# Spotify Clone Web App â€” Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to build a Spotify-like web application using **React** with **TypeScript** that connects to a specified **Google Drive folder** to display songs and allows users to download songs for offline listening. The app will be **progressive** (PWA) and work offline, with robust testing coverage.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- **Tech Stack**
  - React + TypeScript
  - React Router
  - Material UI or Chakra UI for styling
  - Google Drive REST API (OAuth 2.0)
  - Service Workers (PWA)
  - IndexedDB (for offline song storage)
  - React Testing Library + Jest
  - Vite or Create React App (with PWA template)

- **Initial Setup**
  - Bootstrap React TS project.
  - Set up linting, prettier, and pre-commit hooks.
  - Install dependencies for UI, routing, testing.
  - Configure PWA support.

---

## 2. Google Drive Integration

- **OAuth Integration**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow to access user's Google Drive.
  - Request appropriate scopes (read-only if possible).
  - Handle sign-in and sign-out.

- **Fetching Songs**
  - List audio files (.mp3, .wav, etc.) from a specific Drive folder (by folderId).
  - Fetch metadata (file name, album art if available, size, etc.).
  - Display file list in UI.

- **Security**
  - Never store user credentials.
  - Use secure tokens, refresh on expiry.

---

## 3. App Core Functionality

- **Song List Page**
  - Display songs with metadata, thumbnails, duration.
  - Implement search & filter by name/artist/etc.

- **Audio Player**
  - Play/pause, seek, next/previous, shuffle, repeat.
  - Show current playing song, album art, progress bar.
  - Stream audio from Google Drive (with fallback to offline cache).

- **Offline Download**
  - "Download" button for each song.
  - Use IndexedDB or Cache API to store audio files.
  - List/download status (downloaded, in progress, failed).
  - Allow removing cached songs.

- **Offline Mode**
  - Show available songs when offline.
  - Gracefully degrade UI when Drive is unreachable.

- **Playlist/Queue**
  - Basic playlist functionality (future: add, remove, reorder).

- **Settings**
  - Google Drive re-auth.
  - Manage offline storage (clear cache, storage usage).

---

## 4. Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

- **Service Worker**
  - Cache app shell, static resources.
  - Cache audio files for offline playback.
  - Handle fetch events for offline fallback.

- **Manifest**
  - Add icons, name, background color, etc.
  - Enable "Add to Home Screen" support.

---

## 5. Testing

- **Unit Tests**
  - Components (song list, player, controls, dialogs, etc.).
  - Utility functions (Drive API, audio controls, offline logic).

- **Integration/E2E Tests**
  - Happy paths for login, song play, download, offline mode.
  - Error states (Drive auth fail, network loss).

- **Testing Tools**
  - Jest for unit tests.
  - React Testing Library for components.
  - (Optional) Cypress/Playwright for E2E.

---

## 6. Components Structure (Suggested)

- `App`
- `AuthProvider`
- `DriveSongFetcher`
- `SongList`
- `SongListItem`
- `AudioPlayer`
- `OfflineManager`
- `PlaylistManager`
- `SettingsDialog`
- `DownloadButton`
- `NavBar`, `Footer`

---

## 7. Development Milestones

1. **Project Scaffolding & Auth**
   - Basic React app, Google OAuth, Drive listing
2. **Song List & Player**
   - Core UI, fetch & display songs, play audio
3. **Offline Download & Playback**
   - IndexedDB, download/caching, offline support
4. **UI Polish & PWA**
   - Material UI integration, theming, service worker
5. **Testing**
   - Write/component tests, E2E flows
6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy as PWA (Vercel/Netlify), document setup

---

## 8. Potential Challenges

- Google OAuth refresh & drive API rate limits
- Audio streaming vs. full download
- Storage limits in browsers
- Cross-browser media support
- Handling large folders & pagination
- User privacy & token security

---

## 9. Next Steps

- Create GitHub repo & set up CI/CD.
- Register Google API credentials.
- Draft wireframes for key screens.
- Start with authentication and Drive API integration.
