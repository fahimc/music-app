# Implementation Summary: Persistent Login & Folder Selection

## Overview

This update adds two critical features to improve user experience:
1. **Persistent Login** - Users stay signed in across sessions
2. **Folder Selection** - Users can choose which Google Drive folder to scan for music

## Changes Made

### 1. Persistent Authentication (googleAuth.ts)

**Added localStorage persistence:**
```typescript
- AUTH_STATE_KEY = 'music_app_auth_state'
- USER_KEY = 'music_app_user'
- TOKEN_KEY = 'music_app_token'
- TOKEN_EXPIRY_KEY = 'music_app_token_expiry'
```

**New Methods:**
- `loadPersistedAuthState()` - Restores auth state on app load
- `persistAuthState()` - Saves auth state after successful sign-in
- `clearPersistedAuthState()` - Clears stored data on sign-out

**Updated Methods:**
- `constructor()` - Loads persisted state on initialization
- `loadUserInfo()` - Persists state after loading user data
- `signIn()` - Persists state after successful sign-in
- `signOut()` - Clears persisted state
- `refreshToken()` - Updates persisted state

**Benefits:**
- Users don't need to re-authenticate on every visit
- Tokens persist across page refreshes
- Seamless navigation between pages
- Better user experience

### 2. Folder Selection Component (FolderSelectionDialog.tsx)

**New Component Features:**
- Browse Google Drive folders
- Search functionality
- Root folder option (scan entire Drive)
- Visual folder selection with radio buttons
- Folder ID preview
- Saves selection to credentials storage

**UI Elements:**
- Material-UI Dialog
- Folder list with icons
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Radio buttons for selection
- Save/Cancel actions

**Integration:**
- Fetches folders via `googleDriveService.listFiles()`
- Filters to show only folders (not files)
- Saves selected folder ID to credentials
- Updates parent component on selection

### 3. HomePage Integration (HomePage.tsx)

**Added:**
- Import FolderSelectionDialog
- State for folder selection: `folderSelectionOpen`, `selectedFolder`
- Auto-open folder selection after sign-in (if no folder configured)
- Folder selection dialog component

**User Flow:**
1. User signs in
2. If no folder is configured, dialog auto-opens
3. User selects folder
4. Selection is saved
5. User can browse music

### 4. Settings Page Enhancement (SettingsPage.tsx)

**Added:**
- Import FolderSelectionDialog
- "Google Drive Music Folder" section
- Display currently selected folder
- "Change Folder" button
- Folder management UI

**Features:**
- View configured folder
- Change folder anytime
- Clear folder selection
- Visual indication of folder status

**Benefits:**
- Users can change music source without reconfiguring credentials
- Easy folder management
- Clear visual feedback

## User Experience Flow

### First Time User

1. **Setup Credentials**
   - Opens app
   - Configures Google API credentials
   - Adds authorized origin if needed

2. **Sign In**
   - Clicks "Sign In with Google"
   - Grants permissions
   - Successfully authenticated

3. **Select Folder**
   - Folder selection dialog appears
   - Chooses music folder or root
   - Selection is saved

4. **Browse Music**
   - Navigates to "Your Music"
   - Sees songs from selected folder
   - Can play, download, search

### Returning User

1. **App Loads**
   - Authentication restored automatically
   - No sign-in needed
   - Goes directly to music

2. **Seamless Experience**
   - Stays signed in
   - No folder selection needed
   - Can browse music immediately

3. **Optional Changes**
   - Can change folder in Settings
   - Can sign out if needed
   - Can update credentials

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Strategy

**localStorage Keys:**
```javascript
music_app_auth_state      // Overall auth state
music_app_user            // User profile (JSON)
music_app_token           // Access token
music_app_token_expiry    // Expiry timestamp
music_app_google_credentials  // Google API credentials (existing)
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Tokens stored in browser's localStorage
- Protected by browser's same-origin policy
- Tokens expire automatically
- Cleared on sign-out
- Never transmitted to external servers

### Token Management

**Lifecycle:**
1. Token obtained on sign-in
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Token loaded on app initialization
4. Token checked for expiry before use
5. Token refreshed if expired
6. Token cleared on sign-out

**Expiry Handling:**
- Tokens typically last 1 hour
- Checked on app load
- Expired tokens trigger re-authentication
- Refresh token can extend session

### Folder Selection Logic

**Folder ID Storage:**
- Stored in credentials object
- Empty string = root folder
- Non-empty = specific folder ID
- Retrieved by googleDriveService

**Folder Scanning:**
- If folder ID exists, scan that folder
- If empty/null, scan entire Drive
- Filters applied to show only audio files
- Results displayed in song list

## Testing Checklist
