# User Guide: Getting Started with Music App

## Overview

The Music App lets you stream and download music from your Google Drive. After setup, you stay logged in and can access your music library anytime.

## First Time Setup

### Step 1: Configure Google API Credentials

1. Open the app - you'll see a "Set Up Google Drive Access" button
2. Click it to open the Credential Setup Dialog
3. Enter your Google OAuth Client ID (see [OAUTH_SETUP.md](./OAUTH_SETUP.md) for how to get this)
4. Optionally add API Key and Folder ID
5. Click "Save Credentials"

### Step 2: Add Authorized Origin

If you see an error about "Authorization Origin":
1. Follow the instructions shown in the error message
2. Add your current URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) to Google Cloud Console
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
4. Reload the page

See [AUTHORIZATION_FIX.md](./AUTHORIZATION_FIX.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Sign In with Google

1. Click "Sign In with Google"
2. A Google sign-in popup will appear
3. Select your Google account
4. Grant permission to access your Google Drive (read-only)
5. You'll be signed in automatically

### Step 4: Select Music Folder

After signing in, a folder selection dialog will appear:

**Option A: Scan Entire Drive**
- Select "My Drive (Root)"
- The app will search all of your Google Drive for music files

**Option B: Select Specific Folder**
- Browse the list of folders
- Use the search box to find your music folder
- Click on a folder to select it
- Click "Select Folder"

The app will remember your choice and only scan that folder for music.

## Staying Signed In

### Persistent Login

Good news! Once you sign in, you stay signed in:

‚úÖ **No re-login needed** when you:
- Close and reopen the app
- Navigate between pages (Home ‚Üí Your Music ‚Üí Settings)
- Refresh the browser
- Come back days later

‚ùå **You'll need to sign in again** only if you:
- Explicitly sign out
- Clear your browser's localStorage
- Token expires (happens rarely, after extended periods)

### How It Works

The app securely stores:
- Your access token (encrypted by browser)
- Token expiry time
- User information (name, email, picture)

All data is stored locally in your browser and never sent to any server.

## Managing Your Music Folder

### Change Folder Anytime

1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Find "Google Drive Music Folder" section

5. Click "Select Folder"

The app will immediately start scanning the new folder.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organizing Your Music

**Recommended folder structure:**
```
My Drive
